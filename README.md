# Frontend Animal Categories

## Project Philosophy
I started this project because my two year old daughter is super into animals right now. I hear about them all day and all night. So I set out with this thought in mind. This website is designed to create a data set to organize different animals into categories. It allows you to view these animals in an organized format.
